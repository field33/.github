Hey there 👋 We're [Field 33](https://field33.com/)!

In our Github organization, you will find:

## Tooling to build better ontologies (and utilize them in code):

- [plow](https://github.com/field33/plow): An integrated ontology package manager that comes with a hosted registry instance at <https://registry.field33.com>
- [owlish](https://github.com/field33/owlish): An RDF-based OWL2 library for Rust
- 🐢 [harriet](https://github.com/field33/harriet), our parser for the Turtle format. [Introductory blog post](https://medium.com/field33/open-sourcing-harriet-2d6b30365ebf)

## Ontologies we (help to) maintain:

- [ontologies](https://github.com/field33/ontologies), a repository of ontologies we maintain for public use
- 👪 [ontologies-contrib](https://github.com/field33/ontologies-contrib), a repository of community-contributed ontologies for the Field 33 platform


...and in the future many more of our efforts towards enabling easy building of ontologies and semantic data tooling!

If that sounds interesting to, might also want to take a look at our [current openings](https://field33.com/jobs) to come join us and make the list above grow! 😊

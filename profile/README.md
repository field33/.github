Hey there 👋 We're [Field 33](https://field33.com/)!

In our Github organization, you will find:

- 👪 [ontologies-contrib](https://github.com/field33/ontologies-contrib), a repository of community-contributed ontologies for the Field 33 platform
- 🐢 [harriet](https://github.com/field33/harriet), our parser for the Turtle format. [Introductory blog post](https://medium.com/field33/open-sourcing-harriet-2d6b30365ebf)
- ... and in the future many more of our efforts towards enabling easy building of ontologies and semantic data tooling!

If that sounds interesting to, might also want to take a look at our [current openings](https://field33.com/jobs) to come join us and make the list above grow! 😊
